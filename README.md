# discogs-to-json-parser

Parse the discogs releases db xml file and create a json file output. I created this to import the discogs releases database xml file into MongoDB.

Change line 250 to reflect the directory and file name where the discogs release xml file is stored. Run with pypy for better parsing performance.
